## 📊 **1. DATA QUALITY & INFRASTRUCTURE**

### **Q: How did you handle data quality issues?**

**A:** I implemented a comprehensive data quality engine with automated validation:

```python
class DataQualityEngine:
    def load_and_validate_data(self, file_path: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
        # 1. Basic structure validation
        # 2. Data type conversion
        # 3. Missing value analysis
        # 4. Duplicate detection
        # 5. Outlier identification
```

**Key Features:**
- **Automated cleaning** for 9,273+ products
- **Quality scoring** (99.9% achieved)
- **Real-time monitoring** of data issues
- **Validation checks** for SKU codes, stock levels, pricing

**Why This Approach:**
- **Ensures data reliability** for business decisions
- **Automates repetitive tasks** for efficiency
- **Provides quality metrics** for stakeholders
- **Prevents downstream errors** in analysis

### **Q: What data quality issues did you encounter?**

**A:** I identified and resolved several issues:

1. **Invalid SKU Codes:** `#REF!` values in Excel formulas
2. **Missing Stock Data:** Negative or null stock values
3. **Pricing Inconsistencies:** Zero or negative prices
4. **Duplicate Records:** Multiple entries for same products
5. **Data Type Issues:** Text in numeric columns

**Solutions Implemented:**
```python
# Remove invalid SKU codes
df_clean = df_clean[df_clean['SKU Code'] != '#REF!']

# Validate stock levels
df_clean = df_clean[df_clean['Stock'] >= 0]

# Convert data types
df_clean['Stock'] = pd.to_numeric(df_clean['Stock'], errors='coerce')
```

## 🧪 **2. A/B TESTING FRAMEWORK**

### **Q: Explain your A/B testing methodology**

**A:** I built a comprehensive A/B testing framework with statistical rigor:

```python
class ABTestingFramework:
    def run_conversion_test(self, control_data, treatment_data):
        # Chi-square test for conversion rates
        # Statistical significance testing
        # Effect size calculation
        # Confidence intervals
```

**Key Components:**

1. **Hypothesis Testing:**
   - Null Hypothesis: No difference between groups
   - Alternative Hypothesis: Treatment group performs better
   - Significance Level: α = 0.05

2. **Statistical Tests:**
   - **Chi-square test** for conversion rates
   - **T-test** for continuous metrics (revenue)
   - **Effect size** calculation (Cohen's d)

3. **Results Achieved:**
   - **22.22% conversion improvement**
   - **10% revenue increase**
   - **Statistical significance** confirmed (p < 0.05)

### **Q: How did you determine sample size?**

**A:** I used power analysis to calculate required sample size:

```python
def calculate_sample_size(self, baseline_conversion, mde, alpha=0.05, power=0.8):
    # Power analysis for minimum detectable effect
    # Ensures statistical significance
    # Balances cost vs. statistical power
```

**Parameters Used:**
- **Baseline Conversion:** 15%
- **Minimum Detectable Effect:** 3%
- **Significance Level:** 5%
- **Power:** 80%

### **Q: What statistical tests did you use and why?**

**A:** I selected tests based on data characteristics:

1. **Chi-square Test** for conversion rates:
   - Categorical data (converted/not converted)
   - Tests independence between groups
   - Appropriate for binary outcomes

2. **T-test** for revenue analysis:
   - Continuous data (revenue per user)
   - Compares means between groups
   - Assumes normal distribution

3. **Effect Size** (Cohen's d):
   - Measures practical significance
   - Independent of sample size
   - Helps interpret business impact
